Hi! :wave:

I'm Carlos, a third-year PhD student at the [Sapienza Natural Language Processing group](http://nlp.uniroma1.it/), advised by [Roberto Navigli](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/navigli/) and an Early Stage Researcher (ESR) at [Babelscape](https://babelscape.com/) under the [Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) in the [Knograph project](https://knowgraphs.eu/) - European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.

My main research focuses on Multilingual and Cross-lingual semantics, specifically on Semantic Parsing and Natural Language Generation. 

I am graduated in Software Engineering by [Universidad de Málaga](https://www.uma.es/) in Spain and I pursued the [Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree Programme in Big Data Management and Analytics (BDMA)](https://bdma.ulb.ac.be/), a jointly degree delivered by [Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)](https://www.ulb.be/en) in Belgium, [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/en) in Spain and [Technische Universität Berlin (TU-Berlin)](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) in Germany.
