Hi! I am Carlos, a third year PhD student in the [Sapienza Natural Language Processing Group](http://nlp.uniroma1.it/) led by prof. [Roberto Navigli](http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/) and an Early Stage Researcher (ESR) at [Babelscape](https://babelscape.com/) in the [EU Knowgraphs project](https://knowgraphs.eu/) under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant. 

I am interested in Multilingual and Cross-lingual semantics, especially Semantic Parsing and Natural Language Generation.

I am graduated in Software Engineering by the [University of Malaga(UMA)](https://www.uma.es/?set_language=en) and I completed the [Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree Programme in Big Data Management and Analytics (BDMA)](https://bdma.ulb.ac.be/), that it is jointly delivered by [Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)](https://www.ulb.be/en) in Belgium, [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/en) in Spain and [Technische Universität Berlin (Tu-Berlin)](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) in Germany.
